# nearest neighbor prediction via "cosine" method:

# the user has already called formUserData() on the training set, and
# now wishes to predict a new case; the question is, what rating would
# the user newData give to item newItem?

# first, the cases in the training set for which a rating for newItem is
# available are found; then each such case is compared to newData, by
# computing the "cosine" between the training case and newData

# the "cosine" between two cases A and B is defined according to the
# items rated in common between them; the dot product (in the linear
# algebra sense) of the ratings of A and the ratings of B, among the
# items in common, then divided by the product of the norms of those two
# vectors

# we then find the prediction by averaging the ratings of newItem among
# the k training cases having the highest cosine with newData 

# covariates (e.g. age, gender) and item type preferences (e.g.
# preferred movie genres) are allowed in distance computation for
# neighbors; the covariates are assumed here to be user covariates, as
# this is what findUsrItmData.R gives

# NOTE:  the cosine, though standard, has certain problems; e.g., its
# scale-free nature means two users are very "close" even if, say, one 
# is almost exactly double the other; other choices for distance measure
# will be added

# arguments:

#    origData: training set, object of class 'usrData', a list of
#              objects of class 'usrDatum' (see file findUsrItmData.R)
#    newData: data point to be predicted, object of class 'usrDatum'; 
#             just a single point here, but have predictUsrDataMany()
#             later below
#    newItem: ID of the item rating to be predicted for the 
#             user in newData
#    wtcovs: weight to put on covariates; NULL if no covs
#    wtcats: weight to put on item categories; NULL if no cats
#    k: a vector of the numbers of nearest neigbhors used for
#       predicting; one predicted rating will be calculated for
#       each k

# value:
